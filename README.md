# Me Dashy

The name stands for "my dashboard", but "Me Dashy" is just more fun to say.

Me Dashy allows you to set what tokens you have, and it calculates the USD value you hold on refresh. I created it for myself because I didn't have a centralized way to view my assets from the different wallets and exchanges.

[Try it out](https://me-dashy.vercel.app)! But beware: my database is not encrypted at the moment, so if you input the amount of cripto you hold, I could go and check it. I won't, but just warning you. Plus, I don't guarantee I won't delete the whole thing.
